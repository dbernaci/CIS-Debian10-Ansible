# 4.1.12 Ensure successful file system mounts are collected
# It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media
# may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the
# media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a
# file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track
# successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.

# 4.3 Ensure logrotate is configured
# The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the
# system with logs or making the logs unmanageably large. The file
# /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog is the configuration file used to rotate log files created
# by rsyslog.
# By keeping the log files smaller and more manageable, a system administrator can easily
# archive these files to another system and spend less time looking through inordinately
# large log files.
